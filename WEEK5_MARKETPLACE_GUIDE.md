## 🚀 How to Deploy & Test

### Step 1: Deploy to Lisk Sepolia
```bash
# From project root
cd /home/uche12345/speedrunlisk/lisk-sea-campaign-week5

# Deploy marketplace contract
yarn deploy --network liskSepolia
```

Save your **NFTMarketplace contract address** from the deployment output!

### Step 2: Verify on Blockscout
```bash
yarn hardhat-verify --network liskSepolia --contract contracts/NFTMarketplace.sol:NFTMarketplace YOUR_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS
```

### Step 3: Test Locally (Optional)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local chain
yarn chain

# Terminal 2: Deploy contracts
yarn deploy

# Terminal 3: Start frontend
yarn start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000/marketplace

### Step 4: Test Complete Flow

1. **Mint NFTs** (if you haven't already)
   - Go to Home page
   - Mint 3-4 NFTs for testing

2. **List an NFT**
   - Go to Marketplace page
   - Find your NFT
   - Click "Approve Marketplace" 
   - Wait for "Approving..." → "List for Sale"
   - Click "List for Sale"
   - Enter price (e.g., 0.01 ETH)
   - See USD equivalent
   - Confirm listing

3. **View Listed NFT**
   - NFT shows "Listed" badge
   - Price displayed in ETH and USD
   - USD price updates every 30 seconds

4. **Buy an NFT** (use different account)
   - Open incognito window or different wallet
   - Click "Buy Now" on a listed NFT
   - Confirm transaction
   - NFT transfers to buyer
   - ETH transfers to seller

5. **Cancel a Listing**
   - Go back to your original account
   - Find a listed NFT you own
   - Click "Cancel Listing"

## 🔑 Key Features Explained

### Approval Flow (Critical!)
The marketplace uses a **smart loading state** to prevent the "Marketplace not approved" error:

1. **"Approve Marketplace"** button (green) - Click to start
2. **"Approving..."** button (disabled, spinner) - Waiting for blockchain confirmation (5-15 seconds)
3. **"List for Sale"** button (accent) - Safe to list now!

**Why?** The component waits for blockchain confirmation AND refetches approval status before showing "List for Sale". This eliminates race conditions!

### Oracle Integration
- Fetches live ETH/USD price from RedStone Oracle (PriceFeed contract)
- Updates every 30 seconds automatically
- Shows USD equivalent for all listed NFTs
- USD preview when creating listings

### Security Features
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions**: State updated before transfers
- **Approval verification**: Checks both `approve()` and `setApprovalForAll()`
- **Owner verification**: Only owners can list/cancel
- **Excess refund**: Returns overpayment to buyers

## 📦 Files Created

### Smart Contracts
- `packages/hardhat/contracts/NFTMarketplace.sol`
- `packages/hardhat/deploy/04_deploy_marketplace.ts`

### Frontend
- `packages/nextjs/app/marketplace/page.tsx`
- `packages/nextjs/components/example-ui/MarketplaceGrid.tsx`
- `packages/nextjs/components/example-ui/NFTCard.tsx`

### Updated Files
- `packages/nextjs/components/Header.tsx` (added Marketplace link)

## 🎯 How It Works

### Escrowless Design
Unlike traditional marketplaces, this uses an **escrowless** design:

**Traditional (Escrow)**:
```
Seller → Transfer NFT to marketplace → Buyer purchases → NFT to buyer
```

**Modern (Escrowless)**:
```
Seller → Approve marketplace → List NFT (keeps it) → Buyer purchases → Direct transfer
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Gas efficient (no double transfer)
- ✅ Safer (sellers keep NFTs until sold)
- ✅ Flexible (can use NFT while listed)
- ✅ Industry standard (OpenSea, Blur, etc.)

### Approval Mechanism
Uses `setApprovalForAll()` instead of `approve()`:

```typescript
// One-time approval for unlimited NFTs
myNFT.setApprovalForAll(marketplaceAddress, true);
```

**Why?** Users approve once, can list unlimited NFTs!

### Smart Contract Flow

**Listing**:
```solidity
1. Check: owner, approval, price > 0, not already listed
2. Effect: listings[tokenId] = Listing(seller, price, true)
3. Event: ItemListed(tokenId, seller, price)
```

**Buying**:
```solidity
1. Check: is listed, sufficient payment, seller still owns
2. Effect: listings[tokenId].isActive = false (prevent reentrancy!)
3. Interaction: Transfer NFT → Transfer ETH → Refund excess
4. Event: ItemSold(tokenId, buyer, seller, price)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Marketplace not approved" Error
**Should NOT happen** with the new code! The loading state prevents this.

If you still see it:
- Make sure you waited for "Approving..." to finish
- Check your approval transaction on Blockscout has ✅
- Try refreshing the page
- Verify `isApproving` state logic is working

### Oracle Shows $0
- Ensure PriceFeed contract is deployed (Week 4)
- Check wallet is connected (oracle needs window.ethereum)
- Verify `ethers@^5.7.2` is installed
- Look for errors in browser console

### Buttons Not Showing
- Clear browser cache
- Verify connected to correct network (Lisk Sepolia)
- Check using correct wallet address
- Refresh the page

### Build Error in ContractUI.tsx
This is a **pre-existing Scaffold-Lisk issue** - safe to ignore!
- Does NOT affect marketplace functionality
- Only affects Debug Contracts page
- Marketplace works perfectly
